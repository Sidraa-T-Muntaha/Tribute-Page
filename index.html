                <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Steve Jobs's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and a German-American mother.
                        He was adopted shortly after his birth.
                        Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year.
                        In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.
                        A year later, the duo gained fame and wealth with production and sale of the Apple II,
                        one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979,
                        which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI).
                        This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983,
                        followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984,
                        the first mass-produced computer with a GUI
                    </li>
                    <li>The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985
                         with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, 
                         the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.
                        </li>
                </ul>
